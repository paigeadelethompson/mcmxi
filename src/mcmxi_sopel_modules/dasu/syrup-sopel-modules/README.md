Module for getting info on a twitch/smashcast/mixer channel assuming they are currently streaming, as well as setting up a notification announcement for set twitch/smashcast users when they start streaming. Gives info on twitch users when a twitch url is posted.  Requires hitbox, twitch, youtube API keys.  By default it checks every ten seconds for streaming status of specified users, this adds up!  25920 url calls or more a day.  Twitch API is slow, don't expect instant announcements (sometimes 1m lag time on api), hitbox is p. good and quick.  There are slight issues with it, may randomly not work, and it requires probably a complete rewrite (now in progress). :|  Now requires Client-ID from twitch: https://www.twitch.tv/settings/connections
